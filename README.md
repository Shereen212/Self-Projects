# Self-Projects
1) Option Pricing Calculator:
- This project aimed to create an interactive options pricing calculator. 
- Users can input parameters such as volatility (sigma), risk-free rate, number of steps, strike price, spot price, and the contract's start and end dates. 
- Additionally, they can choose to calculate for American or European options and include greeks if desired. 
- The Gradio library was used for the interactive interface, while yfinance provided the dataset for various stock tickers. 
- All pricing model calculations were performed manually using the appropriate formulas and methodologies.
